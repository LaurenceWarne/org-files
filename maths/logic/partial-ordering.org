#+TITLE: Partial Ordering

* Definition

We say a set \( S \) coupled with a relation \( \le \), \( (S, \le) \) is a *partially ordered set* (poset) if the following hold \( \forall a, b, c \in S \):

1. \( R \) is *reflexive*, ie \( a \le a \ \forall a \in S \)

3. \( R \) is *transitive*, ie if \( a \le b \) and \( b \le c \) then \( a \le c \)

2. \( R \) is *antisymmetric*, ie if \( a \le b \) and \( b \le a \) then \( a = b \)

Note *total ordering* is a special type of partial ordering which also requires \( S \) to be *connex* (which implies reflexivity).

* Hasse Diagrams

We can use *Hasse Diagrams* to visualise finite posets. A Hasse Diagram is a graph whose vertices consist of the elements of the poset, and an edge exists between two \( x, y \in S \) iff \( x \le y \) and there is no \( k \) s.t. \( x \le k \le y \). In such a case we say \( y \) *covers* \( x \).

All relations can be deduced from the cover relations and application of the transitivity property.
