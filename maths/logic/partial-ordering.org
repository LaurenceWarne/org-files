#+TITLE: Partial Ordering

* Definition

We say a set \( S \) coupled with a relation \( \le \), \( (S, \le) \) is a *partially ordered set* if the following hold \( \forall a, b, c \in S \):

1. \( R \) is *reflexive*, ie \( a \le a \ \forall a \in S \)

3. \( R \) is *transitive*, ie if \( a \le b \) and \( b \le c \) then \( a \le c \)

2. \( R \) is *antisymmetric*, ie if \( a \le b \) and \( b \le a \) then \( a = b \)

Note *total ordering* is a special type of partial ordering which also requires \( S \) to be *connex* (which implies reflexivity).
