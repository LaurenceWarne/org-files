#+TITLE: Equivalence Relations

* Definition
A relation \( R \) on some set \( S \) can be defined as:

\[ T = \{ (a, b) : a, b \in S, aRb \} \]

For example, the relation "=" over the reals:
\[ aRb \iff a - b = 0 \]


* Equivalence Relations

A relation is said to be an equivalence relation if it is *reflexive*, *symmetric* and *transitive*. 

** Reflexive
A relation is reflexive iff:

\[ \forall a \in S, \ aRa \]


** Symmetric
A relation is symmetric iff:

\[ \forall a, b \in S, \ aRb \Rightarrow bRa \]


** transitive
A relation is transitive iff:

\[ \forall a, b, c \in S, \ (aRb \wedge bRc) \Rightarrow aRc \]


For example the relation \( \leq \) over the reals is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric and the relation \( = \) over the reals is all three and therefore an equivalence relation.


* Equivalence Classes

For an equivalence relation \( R \) over some set \( S \), the equivalence class of some \( a \in S \) is defined as:

\[ \{ x \in S : aRx \} \]

The set of all equivalence classes forms a *partition* of \( S \): a collection of disjoint sets whose union is equal to \( S \). The converse is also true, all unique partitions of \( S \) denote a unique equivalence relation on \( S \).
