#+TITLE: Sylow's Theorems

* Definitions

*Definition* A *p-group* is a group in which the order of all of the elements in the group are powers of \( p \). For a finite group this is equivalent to \( |G| \) is a power of \( p \).

* Sylow's Theorems

The first of Sylow's Theorems gives a *partial converse* of Lagrange's Theorem.

** Theorem 1 

Let \( G \) be a finite group, with \( |G| = p^k * m \) where \( p \not | m \), then \( \exists H \le G \) such that \( |H| = p^k \). We call \( H \) a *Sylow p-subgroup*.

** Theorem 2

If \( H \) and \( K \) are p-subgroups of \( G \), then they are *conjugate*.

** Theorem 3

Let \( n_p \) be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of \( G \), then the following hold:

1. \( n_p | m \)
2. \( n_p \equiv 1 \pmod p \)
3. \( n_p = [G : N_G(P)] \) where \( P \) is any Sylow p-subgroup of \( G \).
