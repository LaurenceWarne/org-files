#+TITLE: Polynomial Rings

* Introduction

*Theorem* Any polynomial ring \( R[X] \) is not a field.

*Proof* Take \( P(X) = X \) in \( R[X] \). Suppose this has some inverse \( Q(X) \), then:

\[
X * Q(X) = 1
\]

But then evaluation at \( X = 0 \) gives \( 1 = 0 \), a contradiction, hence it cannot be the case \( P(X) \) has an inverse, thus \( R[X] \) is not a field.

This indicates the "nicest" a polynomial ring can be is a *Euclidean domain*.

* Properties

1. If \( R \) is a UFD then \( R[X] \) is a UFD (nontrivial).

2. If \( R \) is a PID then it does *not* imply \( R[X] \) is a PID.

3. If \( R \) is a field, then \( R[X] \) is a Euclidean domain (take the Euclidean function as the degree of the polynomial).
