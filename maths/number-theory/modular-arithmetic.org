#+TITLE: Modular Arithmetic

* Definition

We say

\[ a \equiv b \pmod n \iff a - b | n \]

* Residue Groups

Let \( n \in Z^+ \), let \( S \) be the set of natural numbers less than \( n \) which are coprime to \( n \):

\[ S = \{x : x \in Z^+, \ x < n, \ gcd(n, x) = 1\} \]

An important idea when working with modular arithmetic is:

 \[ (1) \ \forall a \in S, \ \exists b \in S \ s.t. \ ab \equiv 1 \pmod n \]

Which we will now prove. Define

\[ f: S \to S, \ \ f(x) = ax \pmod n \]


To show (1) it is sufficient to show \( f \) is a surjection (\( 1 \in S \ \forall n \)). And since the domain and codomain of the function are the same and finite, we can say \( f \) is surjective iff it is injective, which we will now prove.

Suppose \( f \) is not injective,  ie

\[ \exists \text{ distinct } k_1 < k_2 \in S \ s.t. \  f(k_1) = f(k_2)\]

\begin{align*}
&\Rightarrow ak_2 \equiv ak_1 \pmod{n} \\
&\Rightarrow a(k_2 - k_1) = \lambda n \\
\end{align*}

But \( lcm(a, n) = an \) because \( a \) and \( n \) are coprime. This is hence a contradiction as the supposition implies there is nonzero some common multiple of \( a \) and \( n \) less than this, equal to \( a(k_2 - k_1) \)  (\( n > k_2 > k_1 > 0 \)). Hence we have \( f \) is a injection and thus statement (1).
