* Definition

Given some (infinite) sequence \( (a_n)_n \) we can consider its *infinite series*, denoted:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
\]

We say the *series* converges iff the sequence of partial sums of the sequence converges.

\[
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i
\]

If \( S_n \) converges we say the series is *convergent*, else we say the series is *divergent*.

* Tests

There is no general process for checking if a series converges, but we can apply tests which provide definitive statements for some series.

** Nth Term Test

   If a series converges then its corresponding sequence must be null.

*** Proof
    Suppose \( S_n \) converges to some \( L \) then by the shifted sequence rule, \( S_{n + 1} \) also converges to the same \( L \). By the algebra of limits theorem:

    \[
    (S_{n + 1} - S_n)_n
    \]

    converges to \( L - L = 0 \), but 

    \[
    (S_{n + 1} - S_n)_n = (a_n)_n \implies a_n \text{ converges to } 0
    \]

** Integral Test

   Let the sequence \( (a_n)_n \) be defined by \( a_n = f(n) \) then if the following are true for \( f \): 

   1. \( f \) is defined on the interval \( I = [1, \infty) \)
   2. \( f \) is monotonically decresing on \( I \)
   3. \( f \) is positive on n\( I \)

   Then the integral test states that: 

   \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ converges } \iff \int^{\infty}_{1} f(x) \ dx\text{ exists }
\]

** Comparison Test

   Given two sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \), for which

   1. \( a_n, b_n > 0 \ \forall n \)
   2. \( a_n \le b_n \ \forall n \)
   
   The comparison test states that:

   \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \text{ converges } \implies \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ converges}
   \]

   And

   \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ diverges } \implies \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \text{ diverges}
   \]

*** Proof
    
    Consider the sequence of partial sums: \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k, \ R_n = \sum_{k=1}^n b_k \). Given the convergence of \( R_n \) we know that it must have an upper bound \( B \).

    \[
    \implies S_n \le R_n < B \ \forall n
    \]
    \[
    \implies S_n < B \ \forall n
    \]

    And we also have from (1) that \( S_n \) is monotone increasing. Hence since \( S_n \) is monotone increasing and bounded above, it must converge by the MCT.

** Ratio Test

   Let 

   \[
   L = \frac{|a_{n + 1}|}{|a_n|}
   \]

   Then the ratio test asserts that if:
   
   1. \( L < 1 \implies a_n \text{ converges absolutely} \)
   2. \( L > 1 \implies \text{ the series is divergent} \)
   3. And if \( L = 1 \) or the limit does not exist, then the test is inconclusive

*** Proof
