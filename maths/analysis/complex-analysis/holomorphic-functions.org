#+TITLE: Holomorphic Functions

* Definition

A function \( f: U \subseteq \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \) is said to be *differentiable* at \( a \in U \) if the following limit exists:

\[
\lim_{z \to a} \frac{f(z) - f(a)}{z - a}
\]

Further, \( f \) is said to be *holomorphic* on \( U \) if it is differentiable for all \( a \) in \( U \).

* Properties

Holomorphic functions are quite special.  Here are some of their properties:

1. All holomorphic functions are *analytic*, ie equal to their Taylor series
3. If a holomorphic function is bounded and entire, then it is constant (Liouville's theorem)
