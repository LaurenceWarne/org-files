#+TITLE: Eigendecomposition

* Introduction

Let \( A \) be an \( n \times n \) matrix with \( n \) *linearly independent* eigenvectors \( v_1 ... v_n \), then we can write \( A \) as:

\[
A = PDP^{-1}
\]

Where \( P \) is the matrix whose ith column is \( v_i \) and \( D \) is a diagonal matrix with \( D_{i,i} = \lambda_i \).

*Proof*:

\begin{array}{r l l}
  &Av_i        &= \lambda_iv_i \\
  \implies& AP &= PD \\
  \implies& A  &= PDP^{-1}
\end{array}
