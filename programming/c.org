* Pointers

A pointer is a data type that contains the address of a storage location of a variable of a particular type.  We need to use ~*~ to show a variable is a pointer:

#+begin_src c
int my_int = 3;           // We could use string instead of char[] in c++
int* int_ptr = &my_int;   // Obtain pointer from value
int my_int2 = *int_ptr    // Obtain value from pointer
#+end_src

Whitespace before or after the ~*~ is optional.
