#+TITLE: Precedence

* Operator Precedence

Consider the following:

#+begin_src haskell
strSum :: [Int] -> String
strSum xs = show $ sum xs
-- equivalent to
strSum xs = ($) show (sum xs)
#+end_src

This seems strange but it's exactly the same as:

#+begin_src haskell
minMax :: [Int] -> Int
minMax xs = minimum xs + maximum xs
-- equivalent to
minMax xs = (+) (min xs) (max xs)
#+end_src

This because function application has higher precedence than any operator, so ~f a `op` g b~ is always equivalent to ~(f a) `op` (g b)~.
