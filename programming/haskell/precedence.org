#+TITLE: Precedence

* Operator Precedence

Consider the following:

#+begin_src haskell
strSum :: [Int] -> String
strSum xs = show $ sum xs
-- equivalent to
strSum xs = ($) show (sum xs)
#+end_src

This seems strange but it's exactly the same as:

#+begin_src haskell
minMax :: [Int] -> Int
minMax xs = minimum xs + maximum xs
-- equivalent to
minMax xs = (+) (min xs) (max xs)
#+end_src
