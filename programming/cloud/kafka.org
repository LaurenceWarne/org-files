* Topics

A topic is an independent, named stream of records which produces push to and consumers get records from:

Topics are further subdivided into partitions.  A record is published to exactly one partition in a topic, and it's guarenteed exactly one consumer in a given consumer group will read from a given partition at a given point in time.

See https://stackoverflow.com/a/51829144/10930142, for a rundown on how mismatches between the number of consumers (in a group) and the number of topic partitions are handled by Kafka.

* Commands

List all consumer groups for all topics:
#+begin_src bash
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server <bootstrap servers> --describe --all-groups
#+end_src

List configuration for all brokers:
#+begin_src bash
kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server <bootstrap servers> --entity-type brokers --describe --all
#+end_src
