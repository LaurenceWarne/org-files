#+TITLE: Alarms

* Alarm Attributes

  *Example*: If you alarm on 4 out of 5 data points with a period of 1 minute, then:
  - ~datapointsToAlarm~ = 4
  - ~evaluationPeriods~ = 5
  - ~period~            = 1 minute
    
  ~threshold~ is what determines whether a data point (calculated from the metric definition) is "bad" and contributes to the 4 out of 5 data points rule.
