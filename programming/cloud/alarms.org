#+TITLE: Alarms

* Alarms

The most common kind of alarm is a *metric alarm* which is an alarm linked to a Cloudwatch metric (though more sophisticated alarms are available).  Alarms of this kind are typically configured to trigger after said metric exceeds a threshold in a given number of time periods.

*Actions* are associated with alarms and are dispatched once alarms reach ~ALARM~ state, a common example would be to send a notification to an [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html][SNS topic]].

** Example:
If you alarm on 4 out of 5 data points with a period of 1 minute, then:
  - ~datapointsToAlarm~ = 4
  - ~evaluationPeriods~ = 5
  - ~period~            = 1 minute

~threshold~ is what determines whether a data point (calculated from the metric definition) is "bad" and contributes to the 4 out of 5 data points rule.
