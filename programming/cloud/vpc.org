* Subnets

A subnet is said to be *public* if and only if it a route exists in it's route table to an [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html][internet gateway]], else a subnet is said to be *private*.  For example:

[[./subnet-route-table.png]]

We see the default gateway destination (~0.0.0.0/0~) is set to an internet gateway, thus the subnet is public.

In a public subnet however, it is also necesarry to assign public ips to instances which need to be accessible from the internet *and* access the internet.  This can be done by enabling the ~Auto-assign public IPv4 address~ on the subnet, or alternatively assigning [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html][elastic ip addresses]].

In order to make instances in private subnets able to access the internet, it's [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces-web/latest/adminguide/internet-access-private.html][recommended]] to create a NAT gateway, and an entry for the gateway in each of the private subnet route tables you want to enable outbound traffic for.

** Routing Encore

Also noteworthy is by default all subnets within a VPC can communicate with each other.  This is illustrated by the first entry in the image above with Target ~local~, which by default is added to all route tables.

If your route table has multiple routes, the most specific route that matches the traffic (longest prefix match) is used - so in the image above it doesn't matter whether the default root precedes or supersedes the other.

* DNS

DNS support is determined by the ~EnableDnsSupport~ and ~EnableDnsHostnames~ VPC attributes.  The former (enabled by default) means DNS queries to the local Route 53 Resolver for the applicable AZ succeed on the VPC; the latter means instances with public IPs will be assigned public IP addresses.

*Note* instances will generally receive a private IP address and private DNS hostname regardless of the VPC attributes, though the ~EnableDnsHostnames~ attribute for the VPC will determine if the instance will be assigned a public IP.
