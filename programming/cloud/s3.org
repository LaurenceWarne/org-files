#+TITLE: S3

* Access

S3 allows you to associate ACLs (access control lists) at the bucket and object level to control access to objects.  AWS provides a set of predefined ACLs called *canned ACLs*, for example ~private~, ~public-read~, ~public-read-write~, etc.

However, use of S3 ACLs is not recommended, instead, use of policies to control S3 read/write access is recommended by AWS (though note policies only operate at the bucket level).  Disabling ACLs can be done by [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ensure-object-ownership.html][applying the bucket owner enforced setting]] for object ownership, for example:
